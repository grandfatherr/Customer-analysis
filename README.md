# The projects
Two projects that involve data exploration to derive insights using the R programming language. The first one is a project aimed at driving ad engagements and classification whether a customer will click an ad or they won't. The second one is a project that harnesses the practicability of R to perform data analysis and exploration for Kira Plastinina as well as perform a cluster analysis using various clustering techniques.

# Support and contact details
In case of any querries, corrections or additions, feel free to reach me and share. Corrections are most welcome since I have just begun the journey and being pointed in the right direction would actually go a long way in helping me grow and learn and become a better data scientist. The goal of data is insight and if you find insight that I didn't, do let me know.
